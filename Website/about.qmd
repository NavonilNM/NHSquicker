## Why it was created

Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments provide urgent and emergency care services for serious and life-threatening conditions, while other services such as Urgent Treatment Centres, Minor Injury Units (MIUs), Walk-in Centres deal with many of the more common minor injuries and minor illnesses for which people may attend A&E.
