    "section": "Why the app was developed",
    "text": "Why the app was developed\nA&E services across England have faced increasing pressure, with many departments struggling to meet the national 4 hour standard. Research from the University of Exeter and NHS partners found that while MIUs and UTCs often met waiting time targets, A&E departments were underperforming due to high demand. NHSquicker was developed to address this challenge by helping patients choose suitable alternatives with shorter waits, reducing overcrowding and supporting the urgent-care network."

    "text": "The Problem It Solves\nHigh attendance at A&E for non-emergency conditions leads to long waiting times, overcrowding, and poorer experiences for patients. Many patients could be safely treated at MIUs or UTCs but lack awareness of nearby alternatives. NHSquicker addresses this by providing real-time, practical information - helping people go to the right place, at the right time, and reducing avoidable A&E attendances."
